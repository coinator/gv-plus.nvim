With this plugin each time a visual selection is made, its area and mode are stored.

By providing a `<count>` before `gv` the respective selection can be reselected. 
Without providing a count `gv` works as normal (as well as in case the provided count is too large).

Requires:
- neovim v0.7

Based on [vim-visualMarks](https://github.com/iago-lito/vim-visualMarks).
